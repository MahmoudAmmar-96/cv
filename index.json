Two spatial dimensions are considered and the discretizations are carried out for Cartesian uniform and non-uniform grids. Implementations are then verified and the order of accuracy of the adopted spatial and temporal discretization schemes is validated. Next, an Immersed Boundary method (IBM) with a direct forcing strategy is integrated with both flow solvers to simulate fluid-solid interaction problems. The continuous IB method employs a smoothed approximation of the Dirac delta function with a specific order of accuracy to smear (regularize) the immersed boundary forces over the adjacent fluid cells. The accuracy of the solver then becomes dependent on the order at which the coupling quantities are interpolated. In the literature, there exist different second-order regularized delta-function variants which are well-suited to use with the second-order finite volume solver. However, an appropriate fourth-order regularized delta function is not available and its detailed derivation is presented. At last, several numerical tests with smooth and non-smooth velocity fields are conducted to observe the rate of convergence achieved of both IBM solvers.\n","date":1578614400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578614400,"objectID":"214475e975e620dd62872db751106948","permalink":"https://KhaledBoulbrachene.github.io/project/master/","publishdate":"2020-01-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/master/","section":"project","summary":"Master Thesis.","tags":["Computational Fluid Dynamics","Immersed Boundary Method","Numerical analysis"],"title":"Implementation of an Immersed Boundary Method for a fourth-order Finite Volume Scheme","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"To address the computations of solid particles in a fluid flow, one has to solve the transient Navier-Stokes (NS) equations in the fluid domain with the imposition of no-slip boundary condition at the interface between the fluid domain and the solid object. One way to achieve this is by the application of arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian method, which combines the advantages of both Lagrangian descripton following an individual parcel as it moves through space and Eulerian description focusing on specific locations in the space. However, this method requires adaptive meshing depending on solid particles displacements as time evolves and therefore leads to a substantial computational cost. To avoid repeated re-meshing, the whole computational domain containing the fluid and the solid is meshed with a fixed structured cartesian grid. As a result, the grid will most probably not conform to the solids boundary. Here, the introduction of the solid phase to the governing flow equations is achieved by adequately formulating a source term.\n","date":1561939200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561939200,"objectID":"d327d6df0ece93159ce6b982aa5d9e98","permalink":"https://KhaledBoulbrachene.github.io/project/openfoam/","publishdate":"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/openfoam/","section":"project","summary":"A Project of the course Simulation of Thermofluids with Open-Source Software.","tags":["Computational Fluid Dynamics","Fluid Structure Interaction","OpenFoam"],"title":"Immersed Boundary pisoFoam Solver","type":"project"},{"authors":["Jamil Abdo","Edris M.Hassan","Khaled Boulbrachene","Jan Kwak"],"categories":null,"content":"Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.\n","date":1555459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555459200,"objectID":"9e63a0ca0f06df958938af6b8757f1da","permalink":"https://KhaledBoulbrachene.github.io/publication/journal/","publishdate":"2019-04-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal/","section":"publication","summary":"Drilling is one of the costliest and risky activities in oil and gas industry due to complexity of interactions with downhole formation. Under such conditions, the uncertainty of drillstring behavior increases, and hence, it becomes difficult to predict the causes, occurrences, and types of failures. Lateral and torsional vibrations often cause failure of bottom hole assembly (BHA), drillstring failure, drill bit, and wall borehole damages. In this work, a model is presented to determine the impact of lateral and torsional vibrations on a drillstring during the drilling operation. The model aims to mimic real drillstring behavior inside a wellbore with regards to its dynamic movements due to multiple real situations such as eccentricity of collars, drill pipe sections, and stick-slip phenomena occurring due to the interaction of the bit and the drillstring with the well formation. The work aims to develop a basis for determining critical operating speeds and design parameters to provide safe drilling procedures and reduce drillstring fatigue failure. Lagrangian approach is used in this study to attain drillstring lateral and torsional vibration coupling equations. The nonlinear equations are solved numerically to obtain the response of the system. In this work, we also present a brief description of an in-house constructed experimental setup. The setup has the capability to imitate the downhole lateral and torsional vibration modes. Parameters from the experimental investigations are incorporated for validation of the mathematical models and for prediction of the drillstring fatigue life. Such investigations are essential for oil/gas industries as they provide solutions as well as recommendations about operating speed, lateral and torsional amplitudes measurements and corrections, and the conditions for avoiding occurrence of natural frequency(ies) of the system.","tags":["Drill String Failure","Drill String Safety","Fatigue Failure","Lateral and Torsional Vibration"],"title":"Drillstring Failure - Identification, Modeling and Experimental Characterization","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The main task of this project was to conduct a CFD analysis of the high-rise building JPMorgan Chase Tower, Houston, Texas, USA.

Lateral, torsion and axial vibration modes often cause failures of Bottom Hole Assembly (BHA), drill pipe abrasive wear, drill bit and wall borehole damages.

The Lagrangian approach has been used in this study to attain drill pipe lateral and torsional vibration coupling equations of motion.

The proposed setup is about subjecting the drill-string to torsional and bending loads by rotating it at some given number of revolutions per minute. The rotational mechanism of the tested drilling-string is, in principle, to mimic the rotary drilling operation. In the real case, the drill-string is attached to a drilling bit which cuts through a rock formation. Resistivity of the formation is simulated through designing and building braking mechanism. In order to maintain concentricity and provide adequate stabilization and guiding the drill-string without imposing excessive torque, support mechanism has been designed. The design methodology has been followed in two main stages. The concept generation and evaluation, and the embodiment design were established in the Fall semester. In spring semester, efforts were focused to fabricate the set-up. Important decisions were taken in terms of manufacturing the setup. Preliminary tests were conducted to validate the design integrity and robustness of the setup. Number of tests were conducted to study the motion and behavior of the drill-string and the fatigue problem due to lateral and torsional vibrations was generated successfully. A comprehensive finite element modeling and analysis also developed to better understanding the drilling pipe behavior and obtain the natural frequencies of the rotating test specimens, and consequently, their critical speeds.\n","date":1464739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1464739200,"objectID":"d498c2a50a7ea174c76b4e007a14b638","permalink":"https://KhaledBoulbrachene.github.io/project/bachelor/","publishdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/bachelor/","section":"project","summary":"Bachelor Thesis.","tags":["Mechanical Design","Vibration","Fatigue Failure","Drill Pipes"],"title":"Design and Fabrication of an Experimental Setup to Investigate Fatigue Failure in Drilling Pipes","type":"project"}]
